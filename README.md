# weighted_breadth_first_search
I have used weighted bfs to find shortest distance in the graph.
I made a dictionary and stored the distance values in it.
I have used a sorting function which compares the values of the 2d list and arrange them in ascending order.
I have used a queue  to store the values of the Nodes visited and made a final list which stores the node values which have been visited.
